# tiny-diffusion-sandbox

### Experimenting with various diffusion architectures. Code based on the awesome works of https://github.com/Kei18/tiny-tiny-diffusion and https://github.com/tanelp/tiny-diffusion.

The codebase is a work in progress and can currently only support 2D points in space and one target image.
The goal is to better understand the inner working of diffusion models and exxperiment with various architectures and backbones.

If I can get my hands on some better hardware, I'm hoping to run some scaling experiments as well!
